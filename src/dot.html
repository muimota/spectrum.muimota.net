      <h3>Death of Things</h3>
      <p>Death of Things (DoT) is a series of moving figures representing public personas whose operation depends if these people are still alive.</p>
      <p>Each of these figures has one embedded microprocessor and the ability to connect to the internet. When the system detects that a character has died, the figure will stop moving permanently. A connection between the 'life' of the object and the person's life  is established.</p>
