A experiment that tries to emulate how would be internet if we used 8 bit computers.
Is some sort of media archeology exercise, [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web_Audio_API) experiment and a tribute to the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) computer.

- All the text is sonified using ZX Spectrum's cassettes encoding

- All images are dithered and downgraded to use the ZX Spectrum's color palette

All these tasks are done in realtime in your computer / mobile device. What has no sense at all
